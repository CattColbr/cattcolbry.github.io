This was created to represent the Capstone projects conducted by MSU students. These projects are completed before graduation and are one of the last requirments. The building is modled after greek architecture, the colums spell out MSU. In the capstone of the building are the intertwined circles of the CMSE logo.

## Jupyter Instruct

This logo was my first ever. It features the planet jupiter teaching on a clasic black board, with their pointing tool. It is whimsical and fun and one of my favorite projects.
