# Catt Colbry
 Hello, My name is catt. I am a graphic artist and have made quite a few logos in the past years. These are being used on websites that are used readily and seen by many. I enjoy making thoughtful and detailed logos that read well from afar while being nuanced enough to make you think.

## CMSE Capstone

This was created to represent the Capstone projects conducted by MSU students. These projects are completed before graduation and are one of the last requirments. The building is modled after greek architecture, the colums spell out MSU. In the capstone of the building are the intertwined circles of the CMSE logo.

## CoCo

This design is adorable. The quaint smile and swirl of the cocoa really bring it together. Comunity of comunities had this made and even put it on mugs! The details extend as far as to include the name sticker pulling up a bit in the corner.

This logo was my first ever. It features the planet jupiter teaching on a clasic black board, with their pointing tool. It is whimsical and fun and one of my favorite projects.
